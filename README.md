## General Introduction
League of Legend is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. The data set the project will be working on is a professional data set thatâ€™s developed by Oracle's Elixir. The file records match data from professional LOL esports gaming matches throughout 2022. 

This dataset captures key gameplay statistics and outcomes from all profession LOL match throughout 2022, offering various features such as individual player performance, champions pick, in-game statistics, and overall match summary.

In the game of League of Legends (LOL), a power of a champion is based on five main category: xp(experience), gold, kills, assists, and cs(minionkills). Xp could help a champion to level up, gold helps a champion to buy items, kills and assists help champion to win advantage and gold in the game, and minionkills are the fundamental of the game to help a player to win gold and control the lanes when fighting against the opponent. If a team can have higher advantage at these five features then the team has higher chance to win the game and end the game sooner. These five features serves as an important feature of a match. 

The central question we are interested in is **Given by the stats difference between both team, are we ablt to predict the game length of the match**. The project is going to use data analysis techniques to testify the impact of five features including xp(experience), gold, kills, assists, and cs(minionkills)). At the end, the project is going to use these statistics and other important feature to set up a prediction model to predict the gamelength of a match.

## Introduction of Columns
